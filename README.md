# Welcome to Proserium
The main purpose of proserium is to simplify the handling of physical or virtual services.

Our goal is to simplify the deployment and configuration of services.

### Our plan
The main component of proserium is the [proserium-node-manager](https://github.com/proserium/proserium-node-manager). He manages the [proserium-node](https://github.com/proserium/proserium-node)'s. They start/configure the services.  To control that hole process we have a web frontend [proserium-web](https://github.com/proserium/proserium-web).

### Build
All proserium projets are built with gradle. 
just enter `gradle` in any project.
